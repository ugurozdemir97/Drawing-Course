                <p>In this class we will learn about how to simplify and how to create complex forms. We can create any complex form using simple forms, and as you guess if you are able to do this, you can draw anything from any angle.

                <p>In this class we learn about "how to learn drawing something spesific from imagination". Usin these methods we can learn drawing anything. The next part of the course is the application of this class. In the next section we will start learning "how to draw humans" as an example.

            <h1>LET'S LEARN HOW TO DRAW HUMANS (PART 2 – SECTION 2)</h1>
            <p class="show">&emsp;We will learn how to draw humans from imagination. We will do gesture drawings, simplify human forms, learn the importance of memorizing and learn all the anatomy that we need to know as artists.</p>

                <div class="line">Quick drawings <i class="fa-solid fa-xs fa-caret-down"></i></div>
                <p>In this class we will draw a lot of gesture drawings. To be able to draw humans from imagination, obviously the first thing you should do is drawing humans. I recommend you to draw whatever you want to learn hundreds of times in 10 to 20 minutes and after you start to understand it, try to draw it in faster times like 5 minutes, 2 minutes or even under 1 minute. Drawing slow and fast has their own benefits, so do both.

                <p>You should simplify whatever you are learning and practice drawing it with simple forms. This will let you feel its form in 3D and remember complex structures easier.</p>

                <p>We will start learning the anatomy of upper body, in this class we will learn the important bones and the movement of scapula and ribcage. I think understanding this is really important because I remember to struggle to draw some poses before understanding the movement of these parts. After I understand it however, drawing those poses became easier.
